# Java IBM MQ Example
An example SpringBoot application showcasing using a request/response queue pattern with a REST API.

## Getting Started

### Install IBM MQ Queue Manager

Follow [these instructions](https://developer.ibm.com/learningpaths/ibm-mq-badge/create-configure-queue-manager/) to run an IBM MQ Queue Manager locally using Docker.

#### For MacOS Apple Silicon

You'll first need to run the [following instructions](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/integration/blogs/richard-coppen/2023/06/30/ibm-mq-9330-container-image-now-available-for-appl) 
to build a custom Docker image for IBM MQ Server. This is necessary because the official IBM MQ Server image does not support MacOS Apple Silicon.
